The goal of this project is to visually represent a user's email. In lieu of using my personal email account, I used the Enron corpus located at http://arg.vsb.cz/arg/Enron_Corpus/.

The visualization is made with D3.js (http://d3js.org), and is extended from the Force-Directed Graph implementation (http://bl.ocks.org/4062045).

The Python script jsonbuilder.py, when run, will create the emaildata.json file to be read by the Javascript in index.html.
